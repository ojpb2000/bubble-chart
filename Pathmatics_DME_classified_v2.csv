They'll send you an email saying that you've been approved and then you can start shopping. Now I asked my friend who's a lactation specialist for her recommendation and she recommended this spectrum, S1 plus or S2, but she said that all of the options were great, actually. And once you select the breast pump, they send it out between 20 weeks to 29 weeks of pregnancy. And here it is. For all of the fun accessories, I chose this one specifically because it had a portable charger for on the go. Then it's really awesome. They also send you these compression socks and a belly support pan that I got around 16 weeks. All of these items value about $400.","- Packaging materials including plastic bags and cardboard box

They'll send you an email saying that you've been approved and then you can start shopping. Now I asked my friend who's a lactation specialist for her recommendation and she recommended this spectrum, S1 plus or S2, but she said that all of the options were great, actually. And once you select the breast pump, they send it out between 20 weeks to 29 weeks of pregnancy. And here it is. For all of the fun accessories, I chose this one specifically because it had a portable charger for on the go. Then it's really awesome. They also send you these compression socks and a belly support pan that I got around 16 weeks. All of these items value about $400.","- ESPN

This bottle box comes with a variety of bottle brands to help your little one pick their favorite style. The first food set, solid foods may feel a ways away but a toothy messy grin is most adorable with mom approved tableware. This silicone set is so cute, easy to wash, and best of all, stays put on the counter for minimal smells. And my final tip is to have a great baby registry for the things you need and really need. Using the baby list app is the easiest way to do it. Trust me. You can set up the registry in minutes, pulling products from any store you can think of. Using checklist and guides to help you along the way and then share it with family and friends with only one link. It's incredible. Check it out!","- possibly a printer or a similar device.

Using the baby list app is the easiest way to do it. Trust me. You can set up the registry in minutes, pulling products from any store you can think of.

I am going to show you guys some of my favorite things we have already gotten off of our registry with Baby List. Let's check it out. First up we got this affordable smart bassinet that swivels so you can keep it bedside for easy access at nights, something moms loved on Baby List, as well as this peanut changing table and the must have hatch sound machine. And since my husband's tall, we went with this diaper pale because it's taller than most, and I love that it's got the hands free option. And speaking of my husband, he has had plenty of fun with our baby registry as well. But honestly, we've loved using Baby List highly recommended. It's a universal registry, which means you can add products from any website for your friends and family to buy. We've still got some time to finish the nursery before Baby's arrival, but help a soon-to-be new mom out.

Here are five ways that we make it easy to save. Unlike a traditional baby registry, we let you add products from any store. Exhibit a Walmart. You have total control over your registry, and your friends and family get to choose where they want to buy your gifts from. Number two, your registry discount. This year we change our registry discount, so you can use it over and over again from 60 days before your rival date to 90 days after your rival date. Number three is my personal favorite, our automatic price comparison tool. Babylist will always show you the best deal, even when our price might not be below us. So you can see here, this Graco Smart Swing is actually $60 less at Walmart than Target. Number four is our sales and deals alerts. Our editors have the inside scoop on the best deals per baby, and they create a weekly sales roundup with all of our top picks. We'll also automatically email you if the price of something on your registry changes. So you can jump on a good deal, or tip off your bestie that the baby carrier that she wants to buy you is on sale. And number five, our free hello baby box so you can try before you buy. It includes full-size products like bodysuits, bottles, pacifiers, and tons of samples to try before you buy. Dipper's wife, spotty care, and it is worth over $125.

Number three is my personal favorite, our automatic price comparison tool. Babylist will always show you the best deal, even when our price might not be below us. So you can see here, this Graco Smart Swing is actually $60 less at Walmart than Target. Number four is our sales and deals alerts. Our editors have the inside scoop on the best deals per baby, and they create a weekly sales roundup with all of our top picks. We'll also automatically email you if the price of something on your registry changes. So you can jump on a good deal, or tip off your bestie that the baby carrier that she wants to buy you is on sale. And number five, our free hello baby box so you can try before you buy. It includes full-size products like bodysuits, bottles, pacifiers, and tons of samples to try before you buy. Dipper's wife, spotty care, and it is worth over $125. Babylist is for every budget.","- Baby products including pacifiers

It's a universal registry where you cannot items from any store, but what sets it apart are the interactive checklists and guides written by experts and real parents.

But with baby lists exclusive triad kits, like the bottle box, you can easily find the ones that your baby loves the most. Trust me, it's a major time and money saver. Lastly, let's talk about new planning. Whether you're preparing meals in advance to freeze and reheat later or setting up a meal train, having a plan in place for when baby rises key. Since baby lists is a universal registry, you can easily register for meal delivery subscriptions and gift cards or create a meal fund so friends or family can easily send you some cash to get your favorite take-out meal.

You'll have a totally separate device for that clear picture of Baby with no lag so long as you're in range. As for battery life, the parent unit can go 12 hours on one charge. To extend that, you can switch to Vox mode which puts both the video and sounds on standby after 30 seconds of no noise. But they'll jump back into action if they hear something loud enough like a baby crying. If you're craving more cameras, the good news is you can connect it to 4 to the same HDS 2 parent unit. And swap through which 2 you'd like to see on the split screen. Each add on camera costs about $65. Hope this helps.","- Pillow on a couch or chair.
